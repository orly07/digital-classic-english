    content: `Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.`,

    img: Sonnet29Cover,
    content: `When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee—and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.`,

    content: `That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.`,

    content: `Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity,
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.`,

    content: `“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!`,

    content: `Flee from the crowd and dwell with truth. Let your 
goods suffice you, small though they may be, for a 
hoard brings hate, and climbing insecurity, crowds 
bring ill-will, and everywhere prosperity brings 
blindness. Lust after no more than is necessary for
you to have. You that counsel other people, work 
well yourself; and truth shall make you free, doubt it 
not. 

Be not in a tempest to make straight all that is 
crooked, trusting Fortune that turns like a ball. Little 
anxiety means great repose, and beware also of 
kicking an awl; strive not like the crock against the 
wall38. Control yourself; who control the deeds of 
others; and truth shall make you free, doubt it not. 
Receive submissively what is sent you; wrestling to
win the world invites an overthrow. Here there is no 
continuing home; here is but wilderness. Forth, 
pilgrim, forth! Forth, beast, out of your stall! Know 
your true native land, look up, thank God for all 
things; hold the highway, let your spirit lead you; and 
truth shall make you free, doubt it not. 

Envoy 

Therefore, brute-beast, leave to the world your old
sorry ways; cease now to be a slave. Cry Him mercy 
Who of His own high goodness made you from 
nothing, and draw to Him most of all; pray for a 
common heavenly payment for you and for others as 
well. And truth shall make you free, doubt it not. 
Here Ends The Ballad of Good Counsel of G. 
Chaucer.`,

    description: "Ballad",
    img: SteadfastnessCover,
    content: `At one time this world was so steadfast and stable 
that a man’s word was sufficient bond; now it is so
false and deceitful that, in effect, word and deed be in 
no way alike, for the whole world is so turned upside-
down by willfulness and corruption that all is lost for 
the lack of steadfastness. 

Why is this world so variable, except that people 
rejoice in dissension? Among us now a man is 
believed to be powerless unless by some conspiracy 
he can wrong or oppress his neighbor. What except 
wretched willfulness causes all to be lost for the lack 
of steadfastness? 

Truth is put down, reason is esteemed a fable; virtue 
has now no dominion, pity is exiled, no man is 
merciful, through covetousness discernment is 
blinded. The world has made transmutation from 
right to wrong, from fidelity to instability, so that all 
is lost for the lack of steadfastness. 

The Envoy to King Richard 

O prince, desire to be honorable, cherish your people, 
hate extortion! Allow nothing to be done in your 
domains that may be a reproach to your office. Show
forth your sword of chastisement, fear God, execute
the law, love fidelity and worth, and wed your people 
again to steadfastness. `,

Dead as a stone, while that the swough me laste;
But up I roos, with colour ful dyverse,
And pitously on hir myn eyen I caste,
And ner the corps I gan to presen faste,
And for the soule I shope me for to preye;

Thus am I slayn, sith that Pite is ded.
Allas, that day, that ever hyt shulde falle!
What maner man dar now hold up his hed?
To whom shal any sorwful herte calle?
Now Cruelte hath cast to slee us alle,
In ydel hope, folk redeless of peyne,
Sith Pite is deed, to whom shal we now pleyne?

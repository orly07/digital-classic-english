  title: "The Sound and the Fury",
  author: "William Faulkner",
  description:
    "A powerful modernist novel that tells the tragic decline of the Compson family, once a proud Southern household now disintegrating through time. The story unfolds through four perspectives: Benjy, the mentally disabled youngest son; Quentin, the guilt-ridden eldest; Jason, the bitter and greedy brother; and finally, Dilsey, the loyal servant who remains strong amid the family’s collapse. Through fragmented narratives and shifting voices, Faulkner portrays loss, guilt, and the decay of Southern honor.",

    "A tragic story about ambition, guilt, and downfall. Macbeth, a brave Scottish general, encounters three witches who predict that he will become king. Driven by ambition and manipulated by his wife, Lady Macbeth, he murders King Duncan to seize the throne. Consumed by paranoia and cruelty, Macbeth becomes a tyrant. His reign of terror ends when Macduff kills him, and peace is restored to Scotland under the new king, Malcolm.",
